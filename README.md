Pidgin is an Android language learning app. The premise of Pidgin is simple-- "linguistic immersion". 
This is the phenomenon in which you surround yourself with a foreign language and absorb words
as the fly by. This app hopes to recreate this effect. It is based on the idea that words that
appear randomly, as they do in foreign environments, tend to have more salience than words that are
studied out of books. Random words are assigned to the user according to profiency (beginner, intermediate,
advanced), and any words the user does not know, or wishes to note for later, can be added to an "Archive"
screen, in which the user can view the English definition of the word, along with a simple example. Currently, 
Pidign only supports Spanish, but the other languages can be added rather straightforwardly.

This app wa built using Jetpack compose's "foundation" library, along with "materialUI". 

There are no particular configurations needed to run Pidgin.

For future refinement, the other languages could of course be added, along with conjugations, pronunciation,
and even etymology.
